I am a joint Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University ([Brooke Howitt Lab]((https://med.stanford.edu/brookehowittlab.html))) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ([Sizun Jiang Lab](https://sizunjianglab.com/)), specializing in single-cell genomics, cancer research, and spatial biology.

ðŸŽ“ I earned my Ph.D. at [The University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/), where I worked in the [StatBiomed Group](https://statbiomed.github.io/) under the supervision of [Dr. Yuanhua Huang](https://www.sbms.hku.hk/staff/yuanhua-huang). My doctoral research focused on developing statistical methods to detect allele-specific somatic copy number variations from single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data, with the aim of elucidating genetic diversity in complex biological systems.

Currently, my interests lie in advancing research in gynecologic cancers and womenâ€™s health through the development and application of novel spatial technology platforms, computational modeling approaches, and creative data visualizations to uncover meaningful insights.



<!-- I am a PhD student from [StatBiomed Group](https://web.hku.hk/~yuanhua/) at the [School of Biomedical Sciences](https://www.sbms.hku.hk//), [Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine](https://www.med.hku.hk/), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). -->
