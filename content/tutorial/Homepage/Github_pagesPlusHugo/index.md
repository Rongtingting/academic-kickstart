Hereâ€™s a **comprehensive Markdown tutorial** for setting up and deploying your Hugo homepage using your legacy `academic-kickstart` template. This guide assumes you need **Hugo v0.71** or earlier due to theme compatibility.

---

> **Note:**  
> The `academic-kickstart` template is old and requires **Hugo v0.71 or before**.  
> See: [Rongtingting/academic-kickstart](https://github.com/Rongtingting/academic-kickstart)

## 1. Environment Preparation

### 1.1 Install Old Hugo (v0.71 or Earlier)

- Refer to:  
          [Install old hugo 0.71]({{< relref "../OldHugoinstall/" >}})
- For general Hugo installation on macOS, see [Hugo macOS install docs](https://gohugo.io/installation/macos/).




### 1.2 Install Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll need:

- **Git** (for cloning and managing repositories)
- **Go** (for some Hugo builds and theme tools)
- **Dart Sass** (for advanced CSS/Sass processing, if required)

**Check your versions:**

```bash
git version
# git version 2.39.5 (Apple Git-154)

go version
# go version go1.24.4 darwin/arm64

hugo71 version
# Hugo Static Site Generator v0.71.0-06150C87/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-05-18T16:13:04Z

hugo version
# (You may also have a newer hugo installed, but use hugo71 for this project)
```

If you need to install Git, Go, or Dart Sass, follow their respective documentation:

- [Git install](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Go install](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Dart Sass install](https://sass-lang.com/install)

---

## 2. Project Setup & Deployment

### 2.1 Clone Your Academic Kickstart Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rongtingting/academic-kickstart.git My_homepage
cd My_homepage
```

### 2.2 Initialize Submodules

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2.3 Prepare the `public` Directory

Remove any existing `public/` folder:

```bash
rm -r public/
```

Then, add your GitHub Pages repo as a submodule to `public/`:

```bash
git submodule add -f -b master https://github.com/Rongtingting/Rongtingting.github.io.git public
```

---

## 3. Local Development

### 3.1 Start the Hugo Server

Run the Hugo development server with **drafts enabled**:

```bash
hugo server -D
# Or, if you have hugo71 installed as a separate binary:
hugo71 server -D
```

- Visit [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) in your browser to preview your site.

---

## 4. Build and Deploy

### 4.1 Build the Site

```bash
hugo
# Or
hugo71
```

- This generates the site into the `public/` folder, which is connected to your GitHub Pages repository.

### 4.2 Deploy to GitHub Pages

Commit and push your changes in both your main repo and the `public/` submodule:

```bash
# Commit changes in your main site repo
git add .
git commit -m "Update site content"
git push origin master

# Deploy the site by pushing the built files in public/
cd public
git add .
git commit -m "Publish site"
git push origin master
cd ..
```

- [Academic Documentation](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/)
- [Official Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/)

---

## 6. Common Issues

- **Theme errors?**  
  Ensure youâ€™re using `hugo71` (v0.71) since the theme is not compatible with newer Hugo versions.
- **Submodule issues?**  
  Double-check your `public` submodule setup and remote URLs.
- **Build errors with Sass/CSS?**  
  Ensure Dart Sass is installed if youâ€™re customizing styles.

---

## 7. Updating Content

- Edit Markdown files in `content/`.
- Add images and static files to the `static/` directory.
- Customize site configuration in the `config/` folders.
